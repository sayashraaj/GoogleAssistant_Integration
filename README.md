# MTX Hackathon #

Hi, welcome to Sayash Raaj Hiraou's submission

This repository has the frontend React.js portion in the main folder and the backend Node.js part in the 'Nodee' folder
Open them in different terminals
For react: npm start in the main directory
For node: node index.js in the nodee directory

The credentials for the backend to communicate with the Google Cloud Platform project is in the nodee folder. They are my personally generated credentials for testing purposes in working conditions

The frontend has 3 buttons: start recording, stop recording and reset with their respective uses

The useEffect hook along with useState state management in React allows for dynamically updated content in the project and no need of manually entering and waiting for the api calls

The backend controls the shell from which it is running and thus using the .exec command the shell can be used with any and all commands possible to use in any shell or command line interface (CLI)

The project uses GCP, node.js, react.js, and shell scripting. This covers a wide domain of development and technological stack, thus making this the best solution with the most amount of effort and also maximising the return on effort, offering the best quality tech ideas with a completely working project

Thanking You
